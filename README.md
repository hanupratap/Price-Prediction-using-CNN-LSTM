# Price-Prediction-using-CNN-LSTM
This project explores S&P 500 stock price prediction using two models: SARIMA and a CNN-LSTM hybrid. The SARIMA model uses time series analysis, while the CNN-LSTM leverages both temporal and feature-based patterns. The project downloads historical data, engineers features, and trains the models. Evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAPE are calculated. Finally, predictions are visualized against actual prices, alongside direction accuracy and error analysis. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for financial forecasting.
